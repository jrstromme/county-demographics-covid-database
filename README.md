# county-demographics-covid-database
This repository contains a county-level dataset of publicly available data that may be pertinent to Covid-19 analyses. The source code is also contained here.


## Overview

The county-level dataset is stored in two formats: 
1. Stata: county_panel.dta
2. CSV: county_panel.csv

These should be identical, except stata-date-format variables are dropped for the csv.  The string version of date variables remain
